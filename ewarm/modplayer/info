Added to the player:
1. Visualizer that uses the stellaris launchpad RGB 
(uses red and blue - left and right cahnnels)
2. S3M and MOD formats supported (detected by extension)
3. SD card support (using SPI mode on SSI0)

Limitations:
1. Because of the memory constraints the player only support 
   up-to 14 channels mods
2. Some mod/s3m will not be able to played smoothly because 
   our far buffers are quite small.
3. There are only 1100 bytes of free RAM left.
4. Put all the mods in a folder called "mods" in the root of the sd card
    I'm not sure fat32 is supported....

I've added a small LC filter to the output to limit the high frequency signals.
Here is a site that is help-full link , you don't have to use it 
but it gives a better sound.
(My cutoff frequency is 10Khz)
